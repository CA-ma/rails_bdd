## Summary
An application containing the fundamental functionality of a blog is implemented with the Ruby on Rails development framework in this repository.  The application is tested with feature tests and unit tests using Cucumber and Rspec.

The emphasis for this project is in the development of the backend to fully realize the power of the Rails framework.  Standard models for Article and Comments are used in a nested fashion to create a blog architecture that is intuitive and easy to modify with create, edit, and delete article functionality.

## Project goals
The goals for this challenge are three-fold:
1. Develop application using a test-driven design (TDD) work flow.  Specifically, I use the Acceptance Unit Test (AUT) flow.
2. Implement backend models and controllers that explore the full range of Create, Read, Update, Destroy (CRUD) data manipulation.
3. Create a basic blog user interface.
