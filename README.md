## Summary
**Front end**: HTML and CSS.<br>
**Back end**: Ruby on Rails.<br>
**Testing**: Cucumber feature test and Rspec unit test.

This repository contains a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application that employs the creation, editing, deleting, and listing of articles in a blog-style format.  Users (can log in?) and leave comments on articles?. Feature tests written drafted with Behavioral Driven Design (BDD) techniques drive the development process and unit tests are used to verify the functionality of the models.  Feature testing is accomplished with the [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) testing framework and unit tests utilize the [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) gem.

Those of you familiar with Rails will probably recognize this application from the [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) guide, which is somewhat of a Rite of Passage for new developers.  This is my 'go' of it, with a heavy emphasis on acceptance testing, BDD, and applying each aspect of the Create, Read, Update, and Destroy (CRUD) data management flow.
