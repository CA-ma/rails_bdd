Feature: Create articles
    As a publisher
    In order to add relevant content to my news service
    I would like to be able to create articles

Background:
    Given I visit the landing page
    When I click "New Article"

Scenario: Successfully create an article [Happy Path]
    When I fill in "Title" with "Learning Rails 5"
    And I fill in "Content" with "Excited about learning a new framework"
    And I click "Create Article"
    Then I should be on Learning Rails 5 page
    And I should see "Article was successfully created."
    And I should see "Learning Rails 5"
    And I should see "Excited about learning a new framework"

Scenario: Publisher doesn't enter a title for the article [Sad Path]
    When I fill in "Content" with "Excited about learning a new framework"
    And I click "Create Article"
    Then I should see "Title can't be blank"

# Write another sad path scenario you can think of
